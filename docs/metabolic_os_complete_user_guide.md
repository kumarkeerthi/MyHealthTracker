## 1) What This System Is
Metabolic OS is a daily behavior system designed to help you reduce insulin spikes, improve metabolic flexibility, and build a stronger, leaner baseline.

## 2) Why Insulin Control Matters
Stable insulin patterns support better energy, appetite regulation, fat-loss progress, and lower triglyceride stress.

## 3) Understanding Triglycerides & HDL
- **Triglycerides** rise with frequent high-carb/high-sugar load.
- **HDL** benefits from movement, healthy fats, and consistent protein-led meals.

## 4) How the Insulin Score Works
The score is deterministic and combines:
- Carbs, hidden oils, fruit sugar
- Protein and HDL-supporting signals
- Post-meal walk bonuses
- Dinner-specific insulin impact

Lower is better.

## 5) Daily Usage Flow
### Morning
Identity State → Breakfast Log → Insulin Score check → Hydration quick log.

### Post-Lunch
Lunch log triggers movement reminders, then updates insulin trend and walk prompt.

### Evening
Review day quality, hydration completion, strength reminder, and tomorrow focus.

## 6) Logging Food (Manual & Image)
You can log with item selection or image-based assist. Keep portions realistic and review estimated macros before confirming.

## 7) Logging Strength
Track bodyweight and pull/grip progress. Consistent entries improve your trend accuracy and reminders.

## 8) Understanding Body View
The silhouette updates gradually based on trend direction (especially waist behavior), not one-day noise.

## 9) Using Analytics
Use 30-day analytics to identify stable wins: protein consistency, insulin drift direction, and movement correlation.

## 10) Using Dinner Safely
Dinner is optional. If used:
- Carb cap target: **30g**
- Prefer protein-heavy structure
- Dinner carbs above limit trigger **Evening insulin spike risk**
- Late dinner (after 8 PM) adds a small penalty
- Protein-only dinner receives a modest insulin bonus

Modes:
- **Low-carb dinner mode**
- **Protein-only dinner mode**

## 11) Hydration & Walking Logic
Hydration contributes to recovery quality. Post-meal walking can lower insulin burden and improves evening trend consistency.

## 12) Understanding Identity Score
Identity Score reflects your consistency across control, strength, discipline, and waist trend behavior.

## 13) Weekly Review Guide
Each week, review:
- Insulin average direction
- Protein hit rate
- Waist and strength direction
- Dinner quality and timing

Then set one simple adjustment for next week.

## 14) Troubleshooting
- **Score too high:** reduce carb density and hidden oils; add post-meal walking.
- **Slow trend changes:** focus on consistency for 10–14 days before changing too many variables.
- **Late-night cravings:** use protein-first fallback options.

## 15) Frequently Asked Questions
**Q: Do I have to skip dinner?**
A: No. Keep dinner structured and insulin-aware.

**Q: Is one high-carb day a failure?**
A: No. The system is trend-based; reset at next meal.

**Q: Why do reminders appear after lunch?**
A: This is the highest leverage time for movement-related insulin support.
