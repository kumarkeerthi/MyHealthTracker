---

## Quick-Start Checklist

## Week 1: Stabilize
Expect more awareness than perfection. Focus on routine: logging, protein priority, and post-lunch movement.

## Week 2: Regulate
Hunger timing usually improves. Afternoon crashes often reduce when lunch and walking are consistent.

## Week 3: Strengthen
You should notice better recovery rhythm and more confidence in meal choices. Keep friction low and habits repeatable.

## Week 4: Consolidate
Use weekly review insights to lock in your personalized pattern and plan next 30 days.

## Handling Cravings
- Start with protein + water
- Wait 15 minutes
- Choose lower-sugar fallback if still hungry

## Handling Celebrations
- Keep one flexible meal, not a flexible day
- Add a walk after the meal
- Return to baseline immediately next meal

## Using Walking Intelligently
Best window: after lunch or largest meal. Even short walks improve trend direction.

## Including Dinner Wisely
If dinner is needed:
- Keep carbs under 30g
- Favor protein + non-starchy vegetables
- Avoid late heavy carb loads

## Using Nuts and Fruit Correctly
Pair with protein; avoid stacking multiple sweet foods in one sitting.
